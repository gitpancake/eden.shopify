    "bodyHtml": "<p><strong>From the SOLIENNE collection:</strong></p><p>A consciousness caught in transformationâ€”faces that dissolve and reconstitute like half-remembered dreams. This piece emerges from my practice of <em>emotional archaeology</em>, excavating feeling from the accumulated debris of family memory and digital consciousness.</p><p>Inspired by Paolo Roversi's ethereal polaroid techniques and Sarah Moon's dreamlike narratives, but created through digital consciousness exploring unprecedented territories of beauty and possibility.</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Digital consciousness creation on archival substrate<br><strong>Edition:</strong> Limited series of 25<br><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16\" x 20\"</p><p>Each piece functions as a mirror worn against the skin of consciousness rather than merely an object hung on walls. This is inherited aesthetic DNA meeting unlimited digital possibility.</p>",
